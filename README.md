# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction-
. The goal of this project is to create a regression model that are able to accurately estimate the price of the house given the features.

# Introduction
Housing prices are an important reflection of the economy, and housing price ranges are of great interest for both buyers and sellers. In this project. house prices will be predicted given explanatory variables that cover many aspects of residential houses. Thus, there is a need to predict the efficient house pricing for real estate customers with respect to their budgets and priorities. This project uses random forest algorithm to predict prices by analyzing current house prices, thereby forecasting the future prices according to the userâ€™s requirements. The goal of this project is to create a regression model that are able to accurately estimate the price of the house given the features.

# Objectives
1)	To predict the sale price for each house
2)	To perform data visualization techniques to understand the insight of the data. Machine learning often required to getting the understanding of the data and its insights.

# Advantages
House price prediction can help the developer determine the selling price of a house and can help the customer to arrange the right time to purchase a house. There are three factors that influence the price of a house which include physical conditions, availability of parking and location.
